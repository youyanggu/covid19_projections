## Help support an unbiased, rigorous, data-driven approach to COVID-19

{% include iframe_donate.html %}

### **February 2021 Update:** Thank you for your interest in donating to my project. I am very grateful to have reached my fundraising goal - we had over 600 donors! If you are still interested in donating, I kindly request that you consider a donation to your [local food bank](https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank) or [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/).

*covid19-projections.com* is entirely built and run by myself, [Youyang Gu](https://youyanggu.com). Since April, I have volunteered thousands of hours of my time to making sure that people have the best data and model possible to make informed decisions.

I didn't set up this page until December because I wanted to focus purely on the modeling. Having your support now would make my job much easier and allow me to continue focusing full-time on providing the best COVID-19 modeling and analysis.

I hope to continue to dedicate my efforts to this project for as long as possible, until [normality returns](/path-to-herd-immunity).

With your donation, I can:

- Continue to work on *covid19-projections.com* full-time
- Pay for dedicated hosting and computing
- Expand research efforts
- Increase reach
- Fight misinformation
- Inspire further action

*January 2021 Update:* For the purpose of full disclosure, I have also received a grant from [Emergent Ventures](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures) to support my COVID-19 modeling efforts.

## We do more with less

You can be confident that each dollar donated will be used in the most efficient way possible.

Any excess funds will be saved for future public health modeling efforts. I hope to eventually expand upon my COVID-19 work to continue to present the same unbiased, rigorous, and data-driven approach to public health.

I am very much appreciative and grateful for all of your support over the past year. Without the support, I would not have been able to keep this project going for as long as I did. I [look forward](https://youyanggu.com/blog/a-dose-of-optimism) to a better 2021.

With my sincerest gratitude,
