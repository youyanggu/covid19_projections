*Data source: [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) and [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). Due to the inherent lag in the reporting of cases, our estimates of infections is for 14 days ago. Our infections estimates include all infected individuals of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is several times greater than the number of confirmed cases. Dynamic table generated using [csvtotable](https://github.com/vividvilla/csvtotable).*
